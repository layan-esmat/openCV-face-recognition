# OpenCV Face Detection & Image Capture

This project uses **OpenCV** in Python to detect a face through a webcam and capture an image when a face is detected. It simulates part of a smart door system or an access log based on facial presence.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library (`opencv-python`)
- Webcam (built-in or USB)

## How It Works

- Opens the webcam using OpenCV.
- Uses Haar cascades to detect a human face.
- Captures and saves an image when a face is found.

## Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python
